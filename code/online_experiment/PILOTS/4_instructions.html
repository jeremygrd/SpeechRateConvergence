      "<p> It is up to you whether or not to take part. If you decide to take part we will ask you to give your consent by checking boxes to indicate your agreement with a series of statements. However, even after you have given your consent, you can withdraw from the study without having to give us a reason.<p>" +

Your task will be to type as many words as you understood and rate the intelligibility of the sentences (e.g., the ease with which you understand the spoken words present in the audio) on a 1 to 7 scale. Your behavioural responses will be recorded. The task will be explained in detail.<p>" ,

Personally identifiable information includes your Prolific ID- information from which you could be identified and that we use to contact you. Anonymised research data includes information like the buttons you pushed on a computer task and your answers on a questionnaire. In other words, information from which it would not be possible, or very difficult, to identify you personally once it is no longer connected to your Personally Identifiable Information.<p>" +

      "<p>In addition to our own analyses, we agree with the principle that research data, collected with public money, are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible. In line with this we may also share anonymised research data with other researchers in the UK and around the world and may make anonymised research data available as “Open Data”.<p>" +

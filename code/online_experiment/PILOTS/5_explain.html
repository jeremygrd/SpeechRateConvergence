Please use the best quality headphones that you have access to. For the next 20 minutes, you will listen to various <b>speech excerpts</b>. After each excerpt you will be asked to report by typing with you keyboard what you heard. You will also rate the sentence's <b>intelligibility</b>, (the ease with which you understand the spoken words present in the audio). First, you are required to give your consent to take part in the study. You will also complete a short questionnaire related to your language abilities. Next, you will be able to adjust the sound volume to your preference before beginning the experiment. You will then complete a short test to be sure that you are wearing headphones. You will start with some example trials to get familiar with the task. Then you will continue to the main experiment where the task is exactly the same. At multiple points you will have the opportunity to take breaks to stay focussed throughout the experiment.</p></div>" +
